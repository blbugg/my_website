## Hello World...

I am just a girl in a grown up world, trying her best to not grow up.

I am currently an adjunct instructor in the College of Science, Department of Biology at 
Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. I have received Bachelor of Science degrees in Biology
and Botany from Utah Valley University in 2017 and 2022 respectively. Teaching is my absolute favorite thing, and the time I spend with my students is something I truly treasure.

My best friends are of the Avian kind.

My life is currently dictated by a 4 year old tyrant.

My 196 plants are what keep me sane most days.
